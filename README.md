# Computer-Vision-Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my beginner computer vision projects! This repository serves as a notebook to keep track of my learning progress in the fascinating field of computer vision.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find various computer vision projects that I have worked on as part of my learning journey. Most of the codes here are based on tutorials from YouTube and other online resources. As a molecular biology and genetics graduate, I aim to combine computer vision with biology in future projects to explore exciting interdisciplinary applications.

## Projects
